"""
Discriminator score -> per-sample weight (w_i) for data-quality-aware
post-training (Dexora §III-D, Eq.(8)).

We follow the DWBC mapping from Xu et al. ICML 2022 ("Discriminator-Weighted
Offline Imitation Learning From Suboptimal Demonstrations", ref. [41] in the
Dexora paper):

    w_i = clip( d / (eta * (1 - d) + d) , w_min, w_max )

where ``d = d(C_i)`` is the discriminator output in (0, 1] and ``eta`` is the
PU-loss positive weight used at discriminator training time (paper: 0.5).
The mapping is monotonically increasing in ``d``, equals 1 when ``d -> 1`` and
``eta -> 0``, and pushes ``w -> 0`` as ``d -> 0``.

A short linear warm-up is applied during the first ``warmup_steps`` post-training
steps. The warm-up interpolates each sample's weight between 1.0 and its
DWBC-computed value, so the policy is initially trained with vanilla diffusion
loss and gradually transitions to the quality-weighted objective.

We also expose :func:`weighted_mse_loss`, the small reusable building block
that implements Eq.(8) on top of any prediction / target tensors.
